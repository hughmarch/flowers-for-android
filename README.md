# RPA Spot Counter Demo

This demo includes the basic UI and camera functionality on Android needed for point-of-care RPA viral load quantification: automatically taking images defined by an interval and duration.

Images can be stored as numpy arrays (as per the demo) and later processed using OpenCV.

The repository includes a .apk file which can be installed and ran on an Android phone.
